#does not open a session when a request comes in
#SpringBoot defaults this to true, opens a read/write session for OGM
# which makes all transactions read/write, even on queries marked as read-only
# That can cause issues in a Neo4j cluster because writes are sent only to the leader in the cluster
#With this property set to false, recognizes read-only requests and can send to read replicas
